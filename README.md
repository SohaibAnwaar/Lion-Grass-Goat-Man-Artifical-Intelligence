# Problem
A man has a lion,a goat and grass...he has to pass through the river with one boat, but...?
the boat can only carry 2 things at a time so its either the man and the lion or goat or grass, he has to come back for the other 2 and carry them one after the other...if he takes the lion, the goat will eat the grass and that is not good, if he takes the grass, the lion will eat the goat and that is also not good...how is the man supposed to take all three of them.

# Solution
We are going to implement this in python using trees and Queue Data-Structure. We will find every possible of paths from one state and check is it true? is it repeating ? than if it is true and not repeating we will change it state to true. means this option s true and we can go further with this solution. If that state is not true means (lion and goat are alone) or (goat and grass are alone) means this state is false or the state is repeating than we will discard that state by doing this we will go upto the final solution.
